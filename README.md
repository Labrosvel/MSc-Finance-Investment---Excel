Information efficiency of commodities' futures

The objective of the current study is to examine the market efficiency between the spot and futures prices of hard commodities. Cointegration theory is employed to test the assumption that the futures prices of hard commodities are a reliable predictor of the spot prices at the end of the contract. The results are consistent with this assumption which means that markets are efficient. In this study was also investigated the presence of time-varying risk premium under the general concept of market efficiency. The test showed that such a risk premium is present in the hard commodity market.
